# Workstation Builder

This is a series of shell scripts to build an macOS development environment from scratch.

## Requirements

* macOS Sierra (Most of the scripts should probably work on older versions of OSX as well)

## Usage

Run `./setup.sh`

## Development

Currently these scripts are built in Bash.

Linting is done with [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

## Future Development

Ideally, I'd like to port this to [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) or
[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com).
