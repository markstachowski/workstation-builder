# Workstation Builder

This is a basic shell script to build an OSX development environment from scratch.

## Development

Currently this script is built in Bash.

Linting is done with [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

## Future Development

Ideally, I'd like to port this to [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) or
[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com).
